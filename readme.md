# THE ORACLE FOR TRANSFEMINIST TECHNOLOGIES RANDOM CARD GENERATOR



This is a random generator based on the [Oracle for Transfeminist Technologies](https://www.transfeministech.codingrights.org/), a hands-on card deck designed to help us collectively envision and share ideas for transfeminist technologies from the future. You can read more about the team behind the tarot deck [here](https://www.transfeministech.codingrights.org/about). I've included their illustrations and documentation in the repo for educational purposes. The original materials are available [here](https://www.transfeministech.codingrights.org/resources), with additional materials in Spanish and Portuguese. You can donate to the project [via the website](https://www.transfeministech.codingrights.org/).



I coded this random generator to be able to easily use the cards in an online workshop through [Hyperlink Academy](https://hyperlink.academy/) on [Gender in Digital Interfaces](https://hyperlink.academy/courses/gender-in-digital-interfaces/103). Clicking the button will give you a random assortment of cards from each deck to use in ideation and brainstorming practices.
